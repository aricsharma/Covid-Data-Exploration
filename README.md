# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

This project performs exploratory data analysis on global COVID-19 data using SQL. It focuses on identifying trends related to infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.

## Overview

The dataset includes information on:
- Total cases and deaths
- New cases and deaths per day
- Population statistics
- Vaccination data

The analysis is performed using SQL with a focus on:
- Calculating death rates by country and continent
- Identifying countries with the highest infection and death counts
- Comparing infection rates to total population
- Analyzing vaccination trends over time using rolling sums

## Skills Demonstrated

- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Temporary Tables
- Creating Views
- Data Type Conversion

## Data Sources

- `CovidDeaths`: Contains daily reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths
- `CovidVaccinations`: Contains vaccination data by date and country

## Tools Used

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- COVID-19 public datasets (from sources like Our World in Data)

## How to Use

1. Import the dataset into your SQL environment.
2. Run the SQL queries provided in the project file.
3. Modify queries as needed to explore different aspects of the data.

## Note

All analyses are based on available data as of the time of project execution. Some values may change depending on the latest updates to the dataset.
